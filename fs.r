    options(repr.plot.width=width, repr.plot.height=height)
    }

# The R function fs you provided is a custom function designed to conveniently set the width and height of plots displayed in environments that use the repr package, such as Jupyter notebooks, R Markdown documents when rendered interactively, and some R IDEs. Let's break down the function definition and its purpose in detail.

# Function Definition:

# fs <- function(width=10, height=10){
#     options(repr.plot.width=width, repr.plot.height=height)
# }
# Use code with caution.
# R
# fs <- function(...) { ... }: This is the standard way to define a function in R.

# fs: This is the name you are assigning to the function. You can choose any valid R name. In this case, fs is likely short for "figure size" or "plot size," indicating its purpose.

# function(width=10, height=10): This part defines the function's parameters or arguments.

# width=10: This defines a parameter named width with a default value of 10. If you call the function without providing a value for width, it will automatically use 10.

# height=10: Similarly, this defines a parameter named height with a default value of 10. It will default to 10 if no value is provided when calling the function.

# { ... }: The curly braces {} enclose the body of the function. This is the code that will be executed when you call the function.

# options(repr.plot.width=width, repr.plot.height=height): This is the core of the function's functionality.

# options(...): options() is a built-in R function used to set or query various global options that affect how R works. It's a way to customize R's behavior.

# repr.plot.width=width: This is setting a specific option named repr.plot.width.

# repr.plot.width: This option is specifically recognized by the repr package. The repr package is used in interactive R environments (like Jupyter notebooks, R Markdown interactive documents, and some IDEs) to handle how R objects, including plots, are displayed. repr.plot.width controls the width of the plots displayed in these environments.

# =width: This assigns the value of the width parameter (that was passed to the fs function) to the repr.plot.width option.

# repr.plot.height=height: This is similar to the above, but it sets the repr.plot.height option.

# repr.plot.height: This option, also recognized by the repr package, controls the height of the plots displayed in the same interactive environments.

# =height: This assigns the value of the height parameter (passed to fs) to the repr.plot.height option.

# Purpose and How it Works:

# The primary purpose of the fs function is to provide a convenient and reusable way to set the dimensions (width and height) of plots displayed in interactive R environments that utilize the repr package.

# When you generate a plot in R (using functions like plot(), ggplot2, lattice, etc.) within these environments, the repr package is responsible for rendering and displaying the plot. repr checks the global options repr.plot.width and repr.plot.height to determine the size at which the plot should be displayed.

# By using the fs function, you can easily adjust the plot size without having to type out the full options() command each time. You simply call fs() with the desired width and height values, and any subsequent plots generated in your interactive session will be displayed with those dimensions.

# How to Use the Function:

# Define the function: First, you need to run the function definition code in your R session:

# fs <- function(width=10, height=10){
#     options(repr.plot.width=width, repr.plot.height=height)
# }
# Use code with caution.
# R
# Call the function to set plot size: To set the plot size, you call the fs function.

# Using default values: If you want to use the default width and height (both 10 inches), you can simply call the function without any arguments:

# fs()
# Use code with caution.
# R
# This will set repr.plot.width = 10 and repr.plot.height = 10.

# Specifying custom width and height: To set specific dimensions, you provide values for the width and height parameters when calling the function. For example, to set the width to 8 inches and the height to 6 inches:

# fs(width=8, height=6)
# Use code with caution.
# R
# or you can use positional arguments:

# fs(8, 6)
# Use code with caution.
# R
# This will set repr.plot.width = 8 and repr.plot.height = 6.

# Generate plots: After calling fs(), any plots you generate in your interactive session will be displayed with the specified (or default) width and height.

# fs(width=6, height=4) # Set plot size to 6 inches wide and 4 inches tall
# plot(1:10, main="Example Plot") # This plot will be displayed with the set dimensions
# Use code with caution.
# R
# Benefits of using fs function:

# Convenience: It simplifies setting plot dimensions by encapsulating the options() command into a function call.

# Readability: Using fs(width=x, height=y) is more readable and intuitive than repeatedly typing options(repr.plot.width=x, repr.plot.height=y).

# Reusability: You can easily reuse this function across different R scripts or interactive sessions.

# Consistency: By using a function, you ensure a consistent way of setting plot dimensions throughout your work.

# Default values: The default values (width=10, height=10) provide a reasonable starting point, and you only need to specify values when you want to deviate from these defaults.

# Important Notes:

# repr package dependency: This function is specifically effective in environments where the repr package is active. In standard R console or when saving plots directly to files (e.g., using png(), pdf()), these repr.plot.width and repr.plot.height options might not have a direct effect on the output file size. For saving plots to files with specific dimensions, you would typically use arguments within the plot saving functions themselves (e.g., png("myplot.png", width=800, height=600)).

# Units: The width and height values in repr.plot.width and repr.plot.height are usually interpreted as inches.

# Interactive Environments: This function is most useful when working interactively, where you want to control the display size of plots within your notebook or IDE.

# In summary, the fs function is a handy utility function in R to quickly and easily adjust the displayed size of plots in interactive environments that use the repr package. It enhances workflow efficiency and code clarity when working with plots in such settings.
